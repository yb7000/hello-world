**genesis of coding**

*today i decided that i needed to re-learn how to code.*
- while i know my way around the internet, computers and how it all works i stopped coding almost 20 yrs ago.
- last night i used ChatGPT create code for an oracle app I want to build
- now i must learn the basics of coding so that I can bring this app into the world
